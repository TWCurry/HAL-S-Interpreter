# HAL-S-Interpreter
A basic project to attempt to create an interpreter for the HAL/S programming language

This is written in Visual Basic .NET for the .NET Framework
This was written as a "fun" project, which got kind of more in depth. It is not intended to be definitive in any way, shape or form.
I started this project as a whim, and it gradually consumed my spare time. So don't expect completeness, expect many bugs. However, I do expect to continue working on this proect for a while, so there may be bug releases and fixes coming.

What is HAL/S? HAL/S (High-order Assembly Language / Shuttle) was(/is?) a programming language designed by Nasa and Intermetrics for use in a variety of aerospace applications, however it's only major use was on the Space Shuttle. 

The implementation is no where near complete, however, has basic functionality, and is enought to do basic HAL/S code.
